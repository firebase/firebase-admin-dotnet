## Overview

[Firebase](https://firebase.google.com) provides the tools and infrastructure
you need to develop apps, grow your user base, and earn money. The Firebase
Admin .NET SDK enables access to Firebase services from privileged environments
(such as servers or cloud) in .NET. Currently this SDK provides Firebase custom
authentication support.

For more information, please visit the
[Firebase Admin SDK setup guide](https://firebase.google.com/docs/admin/setup/).

## Installation

The Firebase Admin .NET SDK is available on Nuget as `FirebaseAdmin`. Use the
following command to install it with the Nuget package manager:

```
$ Install-Package FirebaseAdmin -Version $VERSION
```

Or use the `dotnet` command-line utility as follows:

```
$ dotnet add package FirebaseAdmin --version $VERSION
```

## Supported Frameworks

Admin .NET SDK supports the following frameworks:

* .NET Framework 4.5+ (4.6.1+ recommended)
* netstandard 1.5 and 2.0 (2.0 recommended), providing .NET Core support

This is consistent with the frameworks supported by other .NET libraries
associated with Google Cloud Platform.

Support for .NET Framework 4.5 and netstandard 1.5 is now deprecated.
Next major version of the Admin SDK will terminate support for these
frameworks. Developers are advised to upgrade their runtime frameworks
accordingly.
